      <description>What is this all about?
What is a variable, really? Variables are one of the first concepts we&amp;rsquo;re introduced to when we&amp;rsquo;re learning to code. But there is often a lot more to it than meets the eye.

      <description>Not too long ago I started the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge that invites people to code for one hour minimum every single day working on projects, whether that&amp;rsquo;s one big project, or several small projects. The challenge mostly provides developers motivation, community support, and accountability.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer. I don&amp;rsquo;t ever plan to be. But I like coding. I like reading code. I like debugging and analyzing code. I like understanding code better.</description>

      <description>The hardest the part of anything is getting started.
Basic laws of physics.
An object at rest will remain at rest.
But once that momentum is &amp;ldquo;created&amp;rdquo;, energy is contagious.1
Momentum isn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;created&amp;rdquo;, at least according to the laws of conservation.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>
