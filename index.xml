      <description>The hardest the part of anything is getting started.
Basic laws of physics.
An object at rest will remain at rest.
But once that momentum is &amp;ldquo;created&amp;rdquo;, energy is contagious.1
Momentum isn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;created&amp;rdquo;, at least according to the laws of conservation.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>

      <description>Not too long ago I started the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
It&amp;rsquo;s a challenge that invites people to code for one hour minimum every single day working on projects, whether that&amp;rsquo;s one big project, or several small projects. The challenge mostly provides developers motivation, community support, and accountability.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer. I don&amp;rsquo;t ever plan to be. But I like coding. I like reading code. I like debugging and analyzing code. I like understanding code better.</description>

      <description>What is this all about?
What is a variable, really? Variables are one of the first concepts we&amp;rsquo;re introduced to when we&amp;rsquo;re learning to code. But there is often a lot more to it than meets the eye. And so we are going to take a deeper look at variables to get a better perspective of what is happening when we use them.
Variables When we declare variables, we usually do something like this: int var = 7;</description>

      <title>What is a Data Structure?</title>

      <description>What is a data structure? Data structures are containers that hold things all of the same type.
How are are they used? But what good is it to hold things we aren&amp;rsquo;t actually going to use in any meaningful way? That seems like a waste of space.
So we use these containers, not simply to hold things, but to also organize things, perhaps process or do something with these things in some way, and even retrieve things.</description>
